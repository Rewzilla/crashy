# Crashy
a toy program for fuzzing


## Build instructions

Crashy can by built by simply running:

	make

This will produce a binary called 'crashy'
in the current directory.


## Usage

Crashy parses data files containing

 * integers
 * characters
 * strings

A directory of example input files is
provided in the 'examples/' folder.
When run, crashy will parse the file
and display the integers, characters,
and strings stored within.

Crashy should be run like this:

	./crashy <inputfile>
